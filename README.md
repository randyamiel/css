### What's included

Within the download you'll find the following directories and files, logically grouping common assets and providing both compiled and minified variations. You'll see something like this:

```
soho-foundation/
├── css/
│   ├── _button.css
│   ├── _colors.css
│   └── app.css
└── www/
    ├── css/
    |   └── app.css
    └── index.html
```

We provide compiled CSS (`soho-foundation.*`), as well as compiled and minified CSS and JS (`soho-foundation.min.*`). CSS [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors) (`soho-foundation.*.map`) are available for use with certain browsers' developer tools.
