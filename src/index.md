## Getting Started

The easiest way to get Foundations is through `npm`.

```
npm install @infor/iux-web-components
```

This will download the latest version of all of the assets and install in `node_modules`. Include your desired file in the `<head>` of your application. The `.min.css` version should be used in production due to its smaller file size but the `.css` version might be better in development for any necessary debugging.

## FAQ

**How Infor-UX Is Different than SoHo Components?**

Infor-UX is the basic identity of the SoHo user experience. By having standard colors, text, and basic elements like form fields and buttons, each Infor application can share an identity. Infor-UX is style-only, powered by CSS and using a very generic architecture so that it's easy for any Infor application to use. The SoHo Components add functionality to the basics of SoHo making it easier for you to bring the SoHo user experience to life. With built-in responsive features, complex UX patterns like Data Grid and Step Pattern, and a large library of different components for many use cases, the SoHo components can help you build out the SoHo experience.

Infor-UX is lightweight implementation of SoHo's basic design principles while the SoHo Components are a more feature-rich toolkit of common patterns which you can "drop in" to your Infor application.
